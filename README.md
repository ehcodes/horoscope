# Horoscope

This project allows you to pick your birthday out of two selects and upon clicking the submit button replaces the informational text with your astrological sign, the dates that go with your sign, and a brief horoscope for your sign.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First I added a form in the html with two selectsto choose both day and month and a button to submit the form. I then went onto the javascript and added an event handler for the button that would invoke the single funtion used in this page to determine what astrological sign match's the input birthday.

## Optimizations

If I were to go back I would add randomization for the horoscope so that every time the suer selects their birthday they might get a different output.

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project I got more comfortable using the comparison and logical operators.
